>Intent
1. Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. [GoF, p163] 
2. Recursive composition 
3. "Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory." 
4. 1-to-many "has a" up the "is a" hierarchy

>Problem
Application needs to manipulate a hierarchical collection of "primitive" and "composite" objects. Processing of a primitive object is handled one way, and processing of a composite object is handled differently. Having to query the "type" of each object before attempting to process it is not desirable.

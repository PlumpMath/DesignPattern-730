>Intent
1. Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. [GoF, p185] 
2. Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface. 

>Problem
A segment of the client community needs a simplified interface to the overall functionality of a complex subsystem.

Copy-On-Write Proxy: Defers copying (cloning) a target object until required by client actions. Really a form of virtual proxy.

Suppose we have a large collection object, such as a
hash table, which multiple clients want to access concurrently.
One of the clients wants to perform a series of consecutive fetch
operations while not letting any other client add or remove
elements.

The proxy is the class LargeHashtable. When the proxy's clone()
method is invoked, it returns a copy of the proxy and both proxies
refer to the same hash table. When one of the proxies modifies
the hash table, the hash table itself is cloned. The
ReferenceCountedHashTable class is used to let the proxies know
they are working with a shared hash table . This class keeps track
of the number of proxies using the shared hash table.

Scenario: A class library provides a Table class, but does not provide a capability to allow clients to lock individual table rows.
We do not have the source code for this class library, but we have complete documentation and know the interface of the Table class. 
How can we provide a row locking capability for the Table class?

public class RowLockTableProxy implements ITable {
Table realTable;
Integer[] locks;
public RowLockTableProxy(Table toLock) {
realTable = toLock;
locks = new Integer[toLock.getNumberOfRows()];
for (int row = 0; row < toLock.getNumberOfRows(); row++)
locks[row] = new Integer(row);
}
